project two, words in motion, kai torrey

# project overview
The goal of this project was to capture what community means to me through a written piece of art and then through the use of HTML and CSS visually bring meanings to the words and phrases we feel hold the most meaning to me. For me, I feel that a song that encapsulates what community means to me the best is the 1967 Beatles song All You Need is Love. I chose this song as I feel the lyrics really speak well to both what community means to me, and what a community can do to those who are a part of it. The majority of the verses that comprise the song discuss how there's nothing you can do that can't be done and your aspirations are all possible no matter how far out or hard they may seem, and the bridge ties in these ideas by stating they're all possible through the love and support all around you. I feel this can be seen and interpreted when looking at the lyrics through the lens of tying them in with what community means to us, as the love you feel and receive from those in your community can help you accomplish great things no matter how hard they may seem to be. In this project, I wanted to place the most emphasis on the words nothin’, easy, can’t, and love. All of these words me showcase the meaning of the song best and how through the support and love from your community, all things no matter how hard or daunting they may seem are achievable. 

# technical overview
For the animations and effects used, I decided to primarily use two, the first being transform scale and the second being opacity. The first of these transform scale was chosen to place further emphasis on the words I feel encapsulate the themes of the song the best. These words were created as <a> tags to allow the viewer to interact with them in a more personal and intimate way causing them to reflect on them and their meaning in relation to the other lyrics. These words were also chosen to be styled differently to differentiate them even further. The font face chosen for the <a> tags is Caveat cursive to give them a more personal and intimate feel which I feel reflects the meaning of the words and lyrics well. For the remainder of the lyrics, the other text was placed into <p> tags with a hover effect lowering their opacity. This was chosen from both a UX standpoint to help direct the user to where they need to click and from an aesthetics standpoint as well to visually showcase their lower place in the hierarchy. The font face chosen for the <p> tags was also very intentional, Roboto san serif was chosen for its strong geometric forms and its harsh contrast against the curved and human feeling script font chosen for the <a> tags.
